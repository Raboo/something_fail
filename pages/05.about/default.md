###### About

Okay,

I decided to start a blog where I would write about stuff that I do at work.  
I manage the infrastructre on a small ad tech company and I'ed like to think that we work with interessting technologies.

I will use this page as a scratchpad with ideas what to write about.  
Meaning this page will be updated when I get an idea about something I can write about and thus summarize the content of my blog.

* Open Source hyper converged infrastructure - OpenNebula/KVM + Ceph + openvswitch.
* bare-metal image installs via PXE / The Foreman.
* Our home made pager-duty solution.
* Containers and clouds.
* Choosing a blog platform.
